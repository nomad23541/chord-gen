            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <h3>The Generator</h3>
            <p>Through a series of arrays holding the notes for each scale avaliable on the piano, my generator is able to randomly generate chords based on a selected scale and mood.</p>
            <p>Major chords are easier to generate, as you simply skip over every other note in a scale to get a major chord. Minor chords are different however, and the second note in the chord needs to be flattened, which my generator still needs work on.</p>
            <h3>The Sound</h3>
            <p>ChordGen was built using the <a href="https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth">audiosynth.js library by keithwhor.</a></p>
            <p>Audiosynth provides a MIDI sound library for the browser and I was able to utilize this in playing generated chords.</p>

            <h1>It's Purpose</h1>
            <p>I created this website to help me learn more about music theory, especially in creating chords and chord progressions. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I use FL Studio to make music, and having a program that generates chords is very useful in the way FL lays out MIDI notes. For example: </p>
